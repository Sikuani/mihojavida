		<h2>Books and Teaching</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In Spring 2021, Karen Levy and I are teaching a new course, Choices and
				Consequences in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed
				at an introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and will cover a
				range of ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and
				information.
			</li>

			<li>
				D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About
				a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
			</li>

			<li>
				This book is based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach
				entitled Networks. The book, like the course, is designed at the
				introductory undergraduate level with no formal prerequisites. To
				support deeper explorations, most of the chapters are supplemented with
				optional advanced sections.

			<li>J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design. Addison Wesley, 2005.</li>

			<li>
				This book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both
				teach. We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate algorithms
				course. An on-line course on edX entitled Networks, Crowds, and Markets,
				with David Easley and Eva Tardos.
